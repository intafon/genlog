# Genlog

## What is it?

A thing

## Requires

fn
python-imaging (via pip)

## Install

Install using either (as `sudo`)

  `./setup.py install`

Or

  `./setup.py develop`

The latter is most convenient if you will be editing the code.

## Does it guarantee unique file names in any way?

No. It only uses the current time to make a relatively distinct stringâ€”don't
use this for anything remotely important.
